(Thisone sings)

When I
Was younger
When I was much
Younger than today

_
I knew
The answer
I knew the score
I knew what to say to you
or anyone at all

_
And if you dropped the question
I would grab the ball

{time=39}

_
Now I'm
Much older
Now I can see
Things I missed before

_
One world
One vision
I'm not so sure
I can give you answers 
that will fit inside your brain

{time=67}

_
I can't predict your actions
I can't feel your pain


{nudge=5}
_
There's a prisoner deep inside me
There's a feeling I can't let go free
This emotion I used to know
One moment I can't let go

_
Back when I flew wild and crazy
No one ever could stand before me
I used to feel oh so free
Now there's a prisoner in me

{time=97}

visuals?

_
My life
Keeps moving
My heart beats still
I keep pushing on

_
My flesh
Is willing
My will is gone
I can't answer questions 
that don't fit inside my brain

_
I can't describe my feelings
I can't share my pain
Oh oh

(hope)        There's a prisoner deep inside me
(feelings)   There's a feeling I can't let go free
(child)        This emotion I used to know
(despair)    One moment I can't let go

_
(flourish)     I thought I could touch the morning
(meaning)   Nothing ever would stand in my way
(nothing)     I used to feel oh so free
(just)           Now there's a prisoner in me

_
(heaven)      There's a prisoner deep inside me
(money)       There's a feeling I can't let go free
(bloodless)   This emotion I used to know
(protection)  One moment I can't let go

_
(questions)    One time when I felt so lonely
(answers)      A miracle set my heart free
(forgiveness) I knew what I had to be
(pain)            I saw the prisoner in me

Man: The only way you could succeed 
was by failing.
Other: No!
Man: The only way you could succeed 
was by failing.
Woman: Really?

Fade out.
