Scene: private booth at a fancy restaurant
Annai is already sitting in the booth; Thisone ports in.

_Annai: Hey stranger.
 Come here often?

_Thisone: Hi.

(After a little hesitation, he pecks her on the cheek)

_Annai: Why here?
 Your place has been fun lately.

_Thisone: I don't know.
 I want to talk about stuff.
 Paranoid I guess.
	
_Annai: Oh.
 That's why you ordered a private booth.

_Thisone: I thought someone might have bugged my 
sim. Compromised my server.
 A place like this, picked at random, is harder 
to jack without leaving a trail.
 Lately I feel like I'm being watched.

random stage directions?

_Annai: You probably are.
 Nothing's private anymore.
 I'm sure someone is getting off spying on us during our 
most intimate, private moments. 

(she puts a hand on his thigh)

_Thisone: (shudders) Ugh!
 that's -- the idea makes me nauseous.
 I've really beefed up my firewall, but I just don't know.
 I thought we should take precautions.

_Annai: This is exciting! Like a spy vid!
